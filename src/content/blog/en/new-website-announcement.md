Today we are launching a new website for Not Recovered. This rebuild was not about a new look for its own sake. It was necessary.

We rebuilt the site primarily for accessibility and operational reasons. Accessibility matters because our community includes people who live with cognitive, sensory, and physical limitations. A clear structure, good contrast, readable layouts, and predictable navigation are not “nice to have”  they are essential. The new site is designed to be easier to use, faster to load, and less exhausting to read.

Operationally, we needed a simpler, more reliable platform that is easier to maintain. The previous setup made updates slow and fragile. The new site reduces complexity so we can publish updates quickly, keep information accurate, and focus on advocacy rather than maintenance.

This website is also fully open source. We believe transparency and community collaboration make our work stronger. If you want to contribute improvements, fix issues, or help translate content, we welcome you to join in. Your skills can help make this platform better for everyone who depends on it.

Thank you for supporting Not Recovered.
