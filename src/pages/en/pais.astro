		<h1 class="mb-4 text-3xl">Post‑Acute Infection Syndromes (PAIS)</h1>
		<p class="mb-6 text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			Post‑acute infection syndromes (PAIS), also known as infection‑associated chronic conditions (IACC), are
			long‑term illnesses that can follow viral or bacterial infections. They are multi‑system, disabling conditions that
			can last for months, years, or a lifetime. Long COVID (PASC), ME/CFS, post‑Ebola, post‑SARS, post‑polio, and
			post‑dengue syndromes are all part of this family.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl text-[rgb(var(--black))]">Signs and symptoms</h2>
		<p class="mb-6 text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			PAIS symptoms are often non‑specific and overlap across different infections: post‑exertional malaise (PEM), severe
			fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive and sensory problems, flu‑like symptoms, muscle and joint pain, and
			cardiovascular or neurological complaints. The severity fluctuates, and for many people the impact is profound, causing
			loss of work, independence, and basic daily function.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl text-[rgb(var(--black))]">Causes and mechanisms</h2>
		<p class="mb-6 text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			PAIS can follow many pathogens, including SARS‑CoV‑2, EBV, influenza, dengue, polio, chikungunya, and others. The
			biology is complex and still under‑researched. Leading hypotheses include viral persistence or remnants, immune
			dysregulation and autoimmunity, chronic inflammation, reactivation of latent infections, microbiome disruption, and
			organ or vascular damage. The common symptom patterns across different infections point to shared mechanisms that
			demand urgent biomedical investigation.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl text-[rgb(var(--black))]">Diagnosis and management</h2>
		<p class="mb-6 text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			Diagnosis is often delayed because there are no definitive tests for most PAIS conditions. Patients are frequently
			sent from clinic to clinic, told nothing is wrong, or labeled as psychological. This is unacceptable. Lack of tests
			does not mean the illness is not real. Treatment remains largely symptomatic because funding and research have not
			matched the scale of the crisis.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl text-[rgb(var(--black))]">The scandal of decades‑long neglect</h2>
		<p class="mb-6 text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			For decades, PAIS conditions were minimized, psychologized, or ignored. This systemic neglect delayed research,
			denied care, and left patients to suffer in silence. It is a public‑health failure: millions harmed, families
			destroyed, and a medical system that too often chose stigma over science. Long COVID did not create this crisis, it
			exposed it.
		</p>

		<h2 class="mb-3 text-2xl text-[rgb(var(--black))]">A call to action</h2>
		<p class="mb-6 text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			The suffering is extreme, and the stakes are life‑and‑death. Patient communities report high levels of despair and
			increased suicide risk, and some countries are seeing assisted‑dying cases linked to the unbearable burden of
			untreated illness and social abandonment. This must end. We demand recognition, accessible care, and a massive
			investment in biomedical research, now.
		</p>

		<p class="text-[rgb(var(--gray))]">
			If you or someone you know is in immediate danger or crisis, please seek urgent local support. You are not alone.
